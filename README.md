## üê± The Meowgram Connection

MeowChat is designed to work as a standalone application but also as a companion to Meowgram. The hybrid authentication system allows users to sign in with their existing Meowgram credentials, automatically syncing their profile information, including:

- Username and Bio
- Profile Picture
- Follower and Following Counts

This creates a unified ecosystem where users can seamlessly switch between social networking and private, secure messaging.

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or higher)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/meowchat.git
cd meowchat
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your credentials
# (see .env.example for required variables)
```

**backend/.env Example:**

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173

# Firebase Admin SDK Configuration (from your Firebase project settings)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-firebase-client-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="your-firebase-private-key"

# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

```bash
# Start the backend server
pnpm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

cd frontend-vite

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create a .env file in the frontend-vite directory
```

**frontend-vite/.env Example:**

```env
# URL of your backend server
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Firebase Client SDK Configuration (get from Firebase Console)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

```bash
# Start the frontend development server
pnpm run dev
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
