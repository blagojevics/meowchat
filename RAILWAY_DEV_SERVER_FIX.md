# 🚨 Railway Frontend Still Running Dev Server - Fix Required

## ❌ Current Issue
Your frontend is still loading development modules instead of built static files:
- `@vite/client` - This is the Vite dev server
- `src/main.jsx` - This should be bundled, not loaded directly

## 🎯 Root Cause
Railway is running **development server** instead of **production build**.

## ✅ Required Railway Configuration Fix

### **Method 1: Check Railway Settings**
1. Go to Railway Frontend Project → **Settings** → **Deploy**
2. Verify these settings:
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Start Command:** `npm start` (NOT `npm run dev`)

### **Method 2: Add Railway Start Script Override**
If Railway is ignoring the start command, we can force it.

Add this to your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "railway:start": "vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
  }
}
```

Then set Railway **Start Command** to: `npm run railway:start`

### **Method 3: Check for Railway.json**
Railway might be using a config file that overrides settings.

## 🔧 Immediate Fix Steps

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
2. **Frontend Project** → **Settings** → **Deploy**
3. **Ensure Build Command:** `npm run build`
4. **Ensure Start Command:** `npm start` (or `npm run railway:start`)
5. **Save and redeploy**

## 🧪 Debug: Check Railway Logs

Look for these in your Railway deployment logs:

### ❌ **Wrong (Currently Happening):**
```
> npm run dev
> vite
Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

### ✅ **Correct (Should Happen):**
```
> npm run build
✓ built in 30s
> npm start
> vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173
Local: http://localhost:4173/
```

## 🚀 Alternative: Force Production Build

Create a Railway-specific script that ensures production mode:
